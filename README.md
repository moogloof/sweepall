# Sweepall
Basically a port of minesweeper for every device. The point of this is to just practice programming for multiple devices, particularly, embedded systems.

## Requirements
Use `make` at the root directory to see all architecture options. Check the subdirectory for your option in the `arch` directory to see the build tools.

## Build
Just do
```
make <architecture>
```
